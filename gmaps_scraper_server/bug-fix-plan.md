### Analysis of `user_reviews` (Empty Array)

This is a bug that we can fix. The problem lies in how your Python scraper communicates with Google's backend to fetch the full list of reviews.

-   **Go Implementation (`gmaps/reviews.go`):**
    -   The `fetcher.fetch` function initiates a series of requests to the `listugcposts` RPC endpoint.
    -   The `generateURL` function meticulously constructs a `pb` parameter.
    -   **Crucially, for the first page of reviews, it uses an empty string (`""`) for the `pageToken`**. This results in a `pb` parameter segment like `...i20!2s`. This is interpreted by Google's server as "start from the beginning."

-   **Python Implementation (`gmaps_scraper_server/scraper.py`):**
    -   Your `fetch_all_reviews` function attempts to replicate this process.
    -   **The Bug:** You initialize the process with `next_page_token = '0'`. This results in a `pb` parameter segment of `...!2m2!1i20!2s0`. Google's server interprets this as a request for a specific page whose token is `'0'`, which is often invalid or empty, causing the request to return no reviews.
    -   **Pagination Logic:** The Go code loops `for nextPageToken != ""`. Your Python code loops `while next_page_token is not None`. An empty string `""` is a valid "stop" signal from the API, but it is not `None`, which could cause issues if the loop isn't exited correctly. The correct Python equivalent is `while next_page_token:`.

-   **Conclusion:** The `user_reviews` bug is caused by an incorrect initial page token and a potentially fragile pagination condition. By correcting the `pb` parameter to match the Go project's initial request, we will enable the scraper to fetch reviews correctly.

### **Technical Plan: Prescriptive Code Modifications**

Here are the precise tasks to fix the bugs and align your Python scraper with the proven logic from the Go project.

#### **Task 1: Correct the User Reviews Fetching Logic**

This task will fix the primary bug causing the `user_reviews` field to be empty.

**File to Modify:** `gmaps_scraper_server/scraper.py`

[x] **1.1. Update the `fetch_all_reviews` function**

Replace the entire existing `fetch_all_reviews` function with the corrected version below. The changes are annotated in the comments.

```python
# In gmaps_scraper_server/scraper.py

async def fetch_all_reviews(page, place_link):
    """
    Fetches all user reviews by simulating the internal 'listugcposts' RPC call.
    This is more robust and efficient than UI scrolling.
    """
    place_id_match = re.search(r'!1s([^!]+)', place_link)
    if not place_id_match:
        print("Could not extract place ID for reviews RPC.")
        return []

    place_id = place_id_match.group(1)
    
    rpc_base_url = "https://www.google.com/maps/rpc/listugcposts"

    all_reviews_data = []
    
    # --- CHANGE 1: Start with an empty page token, not '0'. ---
    # This correctly signals to the API to start from the beginning.
    next_page_token = ""
    
    page_num = 0
    max_pages = 20 # Safety break to avoid infinite loops

    # --- CHANGE 2: The loop condition is now more robust. ---
    # It will correctly stop when the token is an empty string ("") or None.
    # The initial empty string will be handled by the first iteration.
    while True:
        request_id = generate_random_id(21)
        
        # Construct the 'pb' parameter to match the Go project's structure
        # Using an f-string with quote() is safe and correct here.
        pb_components = [
            f"!1m6!1s{quote(place_id)}",
            "!6m4!4m1!1e1!4m1!1e3",
            f"!2m2!1i20!2s{quote(next_page_token)}", # Page size 20
            f"!5m2!1s{request_id}!7e81",
            "!8m9!2b1!3b1!5b1!7b1!12m4!1b1!2b1!4m1!1e1!11m0!13m1!1e1",
        ]
        pb_param = "".join(pb_components)
        
        # Manually construct the URL to prevent '!' from being URL-encoded.
        full_url = f"{rpc_base_url}?authuser=0&hl=en&pb={pb_param}"
        
        try:
            response = await page.request.get(full_url)
            if response.status != 200:
                print(f"Error fetching reviews page {page_num+1}: Status {response.status}")
                break

            content = await response.body()
            json_str = content.decode('utf-8').lstrip(")]}'")
            data = json.loads(json_str)

            # Reviews are in the list at index 2
            reviews_list = extractor.safe_get(data, 2)
            if isinstance(reviews_list, list):
                all_reviews_data.extend(reviews_list)
                print(f"Fetched {len(reviews_list)} reviews. Total: {len(all_reviews_data)}")

            # The next page token is the string at index 1.
            # If it's missing or an empty string, the loop will terminate.
            next_page_token = extractor.safe_get(data, 1)
            
            # --- CHANGE 3: Add explicit exit condition for loop ---
            if not next_page_token or page_num >= max_pages:
                break
                
            page_num += 1
            await asyncio.sleep(random.uniform(0.8, 1.8))

        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An exception occurred while fetching reviews: {e}")
            break
            
    return all_reviews_data
```

#### **Task 2: Finalize Data Structure in Extractor**

While the `open_hours` extraction code is correct, we should ensure the final output structure is consistent and handles missing data gracefully, as intended.

**File to Modify:** `gmaps_scraper_server/extractor.py`

[x] **2.1. Update the `extract_place_data` function**

Your current implementation already handles this well, but let's ensure it's finalized to produce the desired output structure. This version explicitly adds the `link` field which was missing from the problematic JSON example, and ensures `user_reviews` defaults to an empty list.

```python
# In gmaps_scraper_server/extractor.py

def extract_place_data(html_content, all_reviews=None):
    """
    High-level function to orchestrate extraction from HTML content.
    """
    json_str = extract_initial_json(html_content)
    if not json_str:
        print("Failed to extract JSON string from HTML.")
        return None

    data_blob = parse_json_data(json_str)
    if not data_blob:
        print("Failed to parse JSON data or find expected structure.")
        return None

    # This dictionary now uses the corrected functions and logic
    place_details = {
        "name": get_main_name(data_blob),
        "place_id": get_place_id(data_blob),
        "coordinates": get_gps_coordinates(data_blob),
        "address": get_complete_address(data_blob),
        "rating": get_rating(data_blob),
        "reviews_count": get_reviews_count(data_blob),
        "categories": get_categories(data_blob),
        "website": get_website(data_blob),
        "phone": get_phone_number(data_blob),
        "images": get_images(data_blob),
        "open_hours": get_open_hours(data_blob),
        
        # This logic correctly handles the case where reviews are not fetched
        # or when the fetched list is empty.
        "user_reviews": parse_user_reviews(all_reviews) if all_reviews else [],
    }

    # Filter out keys where the value is None to keep the output clean.
    # This is why 'open_hours' disappears when not found.
    # 'user_reviews' will remain as an empty list if no reviews are found.
    return {k: v for k, v in place_details.items() if v is not None}
```

**Note:** The `link` field is added in `scraper.py` after `extract_place_data` is called. This is good practice and should be kept as is.
