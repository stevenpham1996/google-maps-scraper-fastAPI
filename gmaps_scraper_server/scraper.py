    Scrapes Google Maps for places based on a query.

    Args:
        query (str): The search query (e.g., "restaurants in New York").
        max_places (int, optional): Maximum number of places to scrape. Defaults to None (scrape all found).
        lang (str, optional): Language code for Google Maps (e.g., 'en', 'es'). Defaults to "en".
        headless (bool, optional): Whether to run the browser in headless mode. Defaults to True.

    Returns:
